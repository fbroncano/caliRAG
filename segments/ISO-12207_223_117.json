NOTE Some of the largest software SoS, such as the Internet, are virtual SoS in which the constituent systems are engineered to follow common recommendations and communication protocols. Virtual SoS can exhibit beneficial emerging behaviors such as redundancy, dynamic reconfiguration, collaboration and resilience.
