Statistical tolerancing, to be practicable without necessitating advanced methods, is subject to the following conditions: — the individual actual dimensions can be considered as uncorrelated random variables; — the dimensional chain is linear; — the dimensional chain has at least four units; — the individual tolerances are of the same order of magnitude; — the distributions of the individual dimensions of the dimensional chain are known. It is obvious that some of these requirements can only"
