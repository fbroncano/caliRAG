  "texto": "7.9.2 Benefits Within theoretical sciences, simulation (in particular, the Monte Carlo method) is used if explicit calculations of solutions to problems are impossible or too cumbersome to carry out directly. Similarly, in the empirical context, simulation is used when empirical investigations are too costly or impossible. The benefit of simulation is that it allows a solution with a saving of time and money, or that it allows a solution at all. 22\b ﻿ © ISO 2021 – All rights reserved ISO 10017:2021(E) ﻿"
