ISO 8402 defines quality in terms of the ability to satisfy stated and implied needs. However, needs stated by a user do not always reflect the real user needs, because: (1) a user is often not aware of his real needs, (2) needs may change after they are stated, (3) different users may have different operating environments, and (4) it may be impossible to consult all the possible types of user, particularly for off- the-shelf software. So quality requirements cannot be completely defined before the beginning"
