NOTE 1 For example, the replaceability of a new version of a software product is important to the user when upgrading. NOTE 2 Replaceability is used in place of compatibility in order to avoid possible ambiguity with interoperability (see 6.1.3). NOTE 3 Replaceability may include attributes of both installability and adaptability. The concept has been introduced as a subcharacteristic of its own because of its importance."
