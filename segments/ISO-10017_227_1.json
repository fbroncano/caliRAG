It can for example: a) reveal variability in areas that are critical to product quality, and thereby guide an organization in allocating resources in those areas to improve or maintain quality; b) help to determine whether an instrument is capable of satisfactorily measuring a product or process parameter of interest, and provide a quantitative and cost-effective basis for selecting a new measurement instrument; c) be used to assure customers (internal or external) that the measurement equipment, methods and processes are capable of adequately measuring the quality level to be achieved; d)"
