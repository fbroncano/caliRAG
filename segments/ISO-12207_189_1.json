The System Analysis process applies to the development of inputs needed for any technical assessment. It can provide confidence in the utility and integrity of system requirements, architecture, and design. System analysis covers a wide range of differing analytic functions, levels of complexity, and levels of rigor. It includes mathematical analysis, modelling, simulation, experimentation, and other techniques to analyze technical performance, system behavior, feasibility, affordability, critical quality"
