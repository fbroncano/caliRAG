Note that tailoring may diminish the perceived value of a claim of conformance to this document. This is because it is difficult for other organizations to understand the extent to which tailoring may have deleted desirable provisions. An organization asserting a single‐party claim of conformance to this document may find it advantageous to claim full conformance to a smaller list of processes rather than tailored conformance to a larger list of processes. 5.6 Process groups 5.6.1"
