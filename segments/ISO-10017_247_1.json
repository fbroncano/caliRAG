When tight tolerances are necessary, component manufacturers are required to achieve specified levels of process capability to ensure high yields and minimum waste. b) High process capability index goals (e.g. Cp > 2) are sometimes used at the component and subsystem level to achieve desired cumulative quality and reliability of complex systems. c) Process"
