Full conformance to tasks is achieved by demonstrating that all of the requirements of the activities and tasks of the declared set of processes have been achieved. In this situation, the provisions for the outcomes of the declared set of processes are guidance rather than requirements, regardless of the verb form that is used in the provision. NOTE A claim of full conformance to tasks can be appropriate in contractual situations where an acquirer or a regulator requires detailed understanding of the suppliers’ processes."
