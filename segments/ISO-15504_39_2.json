Apart from guiding the assessment, the mapping of organizational processes to the compatible model(s) forms an essential part of the assessment record. It should be possible, after the assessment has been completed, for any person examining the assessment record to be able to relate the mapping to records of organizational structure, procedures, and standards within the assessed organization."
