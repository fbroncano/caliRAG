  "texto": "organization internally or externally by two or more organizations. When applied internally, the two agreeing parties typically act under the terms of an agreement that may vary in formality under different circumstances. When applied externally, the two agreeing parties typically act under the terms of a contract. This document uses the term “agreement” to apply to either situation. For the purpose of this document, any project is assumed to be conducted within the context of an organization. This is important, because a project is dependent upon various outcomes produced by the business processes of the organization, e.g., employees to staff the project and facilities to house the project."
