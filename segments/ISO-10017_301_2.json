Control charts also help to avoid ad-hoc or unnecessary process intervention by enabling users to distinguish between variation that is inherent to the process and variation that can be attributed to an “assignable cause”. — Process capability analysis: If the process is in a stable state, the data from the control chart can be used subsequently to estimate process capability (see 7.5). — Cause and effect analysis: A correlation between process events and control chart patterns can help to infer underlying assignable causes and to plan effective corrective action. 24\b ﻿ © ISO 2021 – All rights reserved ISO 10017:2021(E) ﻿ — Continuous improvement: Control charts"
