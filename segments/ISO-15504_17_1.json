ISO/IEC TR 15504-2 defines a reference model that provides a basis for rating the capability of processes, based on their achievement of defined process attributes. ISO/IEC TR 15504-3 defines the requirements for performing an assessment and sets out the circumstances under which assessment results may be compared. ISO/IEC TR 15504-4 provides guidance on performing an assessment and interpreting the requirements in ISO/IEC TR 15504-3.
