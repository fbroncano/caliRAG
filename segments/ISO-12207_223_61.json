This example treats a specific instance of a process view, called interface management, which includes interface definition, design, and change management. Within this document, the tasks that comprise interface management are fully contained within the existing processes. NOTE For software systems, interfaces with other systems are a typical way of receiving input data or exporting output data (reports).
