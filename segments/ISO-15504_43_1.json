This is made possible by implementing the requirements for rating processes and calculating results within the measurement framework, and reporting them in a way that makes the results of the calculation obvious. The results of an assessment formally comprise a set of process attribute ratings for each process in the assessment scope. The set of process attribute ratings is termed the process profile. Additional information on the context of the assessment and of the processes assessed must also be recorded as part of the assessment"
