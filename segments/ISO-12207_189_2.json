It is used for a wide range of analytical needs concerning operational concepts, determination of requirement values, resolution of requirements conflicts, assessment of alternative architectures or system elements, and evaluation of engineering strategies (integration, verification, validation, and maintenance). Formality and rigor of the analysis will depend on the criticality of the information need or work product supported, the amount of information/data available, the size of the project, and the schedule for the results."
