If the representation involves concepts of probability theory, in particular random variables, simulation can be called the “Monte Carlo method”. In the context of theoretical science, simulation is used if no comprehensive theory for the solution of a problem is known (or, if known, is impossible or difficult to solve), and where the solution can be obtained through brute computer force. In the empirical context, simulation is used if the system can be adequately"
