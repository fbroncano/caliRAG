Typical areas of applications include statistical tolerance, process evaluation, system optimization, reliability theory and prediction. Examples of applications are: — modelling variation in mechanical sub-assemblies; — modelling vibration profiles in complex assemblies; — determining optimal preventive maintenance schedules; — conducting cost and other analyses in design and production processes to optimize the allocation of resources; — studying a complex delivery process as a cost-effective alternative to"
