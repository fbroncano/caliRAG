The purpose of this review is to evaluate whether the relevant dispute-resolution principles (see Clause 4) and procedures were followed correctly. If there is no review available, or if the organization decides not to seek such a review, the decision should be referred to appropriate personnel within the organization to ensure that the resolution is carried out (see 7.6)."
