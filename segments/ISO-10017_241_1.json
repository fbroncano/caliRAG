If the distribution of process data is “normal” (i.e. bell shaped) and its mean value written as “μ”, then the output of the process is typically defined as μ ± 3σ. This range of values, termed “process spread”, will (in theory) encompass 99,73 % of the output of the process when it is stable. A convenient measure of process capability is Cp, a capability index, which is the ratio of process spread (µ ± 3σ) against allowable specifications, when the process mean is centred between the specifications. Where the process mean is not centred between"
