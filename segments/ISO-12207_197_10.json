As appropriate, hardware elements are verified for conformance to specified system requirements and critical quality characteristics. In the case of repeated system element implementation (e.g., mass production, replacement system elements) the implementation procedures and fabrication processes are defined and can be automated to achieve consistent and repeatable producibility. Some common hardware elements in software systems include integrations of acquired COTS systems, special modifications, e.g., for test or operational environments, and hardware controls with embedded software. 3) Realize or adapt service elements of software"
