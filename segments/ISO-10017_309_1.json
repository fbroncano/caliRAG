It makes use of the statistical distributions of relevant dimensions of individual components to determine the overall tolerance for the assembled unit. When assembling multiple individual components into a module, the critical factor or requirement (in terms of assembly and interchangeability) of such modules is often not the dimensions of the individual components but instead the total dimension achieved as a result of assembly. For a statistical determination of overall tolerances, it is assumed that, in assemblies involving a large number of individual"
