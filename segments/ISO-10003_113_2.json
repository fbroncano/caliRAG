  "texto": "NOTE In dispute resolution, it is not unusual for an organization to decide to offer a complainant one or more remedies that the organization does not believe are required by law, codes of conduct or other bases. The organization can do this as a goodwill gesture, as part of a customer satisfaction policy, or in recognition of the possibility that the dispute resolver, an association administering a code of conduct or a court can view the situation differently."
