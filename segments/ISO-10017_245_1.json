Therefore, process capability analysis should be performed in conjunction with control methods to ensure ongoing verification of control. Estimates of the percentage of nonconforming products are subject to assumptions of a normal distribution. When this is not realized in practice, such estimates should be treated with caution. 16\b ﻿ © ISO 2021 – All rights reserved ISO 10017:2021(E) ﻿ Likewise, in the case of processes that are subject to systematic assignable causes of variation, such as tool wear, specialized approaches should be used to calculate and interpret capability."
