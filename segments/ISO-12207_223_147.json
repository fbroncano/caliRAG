Table I.1 does not imply that process definitions are identical between the 2008 and the 2017 editions of this document. In some cases, processes in the earlier version are now addressed through activities and tasks or described in notes. Other, more detailed mappings to align process purpose, outcomes, activities, or tasks of the two versions are possible. One such mapping is depicted in Table I.2. Table I.1 — Comparison of processes in ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 and the previous edition ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 and ISO/IEC/IEEE ISO/IEC 12207:2008"
