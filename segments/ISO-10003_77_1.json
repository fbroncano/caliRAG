That policy should describe under which circumstances the organization will inform customers about the dispute- resolution process and offer dispute resolution to complainants (see Annex K). The organization should also determine whether it will require complainants to use the internal complaints-handling process before initiating a dispute-resolution process. The policy should be made available to all personnel, complainants, customers and other relevant interested parties. The policy should be supported by procedures and objectives for each function and personnel role"
