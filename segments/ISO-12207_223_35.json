Concepts of continual process improvement and capability assessment are now well established and recognized, and are being standardized in the ISO/IEC 33000 series of standards (replacing the ISO/IEC 15504 series). The Process Reference Models in Annex C of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 and this document are intended to be used in conjunction with ISO/IEC 33020:2015 for capability assessment of the life cycle processes."
